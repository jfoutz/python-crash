This is not an interesting repo.

It's just cranking through https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/

And that's fine. Haven't used python seriously in long long time, fun to  refresh python syntax and fucntions, learning some odds and ends the python3 way. It's also a great excuse to figure out nix dev envs + direnv + lsp + black + flake8. All the things. 

The layout's probably not great. But i feel like i got all the parts in place.
