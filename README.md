This is not an interesting repo.

It's just cranking through https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/ (well the physical book). but i think it's the same stuff.

And that's fine. Haven't used python seriously in long long time, fun to  refresh python syntax and fucntions, learning some odds and ends the python3 way. It's also a great excuse to figure out nix dev envs + direnv + lsp + black + flake8. All the things. 

The layout's probably not great. But i feel like i got all the parts in place.

ok so the book is good but a little slow.
There are some syntax gems hidden away in each chapter, but print-ing everything is killing me.

new plan, jump ahead to writing tests. redo the chapters with all exorcies as tests. Also maybe take a long look at type annotations, https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html and associated PEPs
